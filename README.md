### Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about software development. I enjoy topics regarding cybersecurity and competitive progamming, in fact I jump on every opportunity to refine my skills and knowledge, to mention few SWERC 2024 and Cyberchallenge 2025. I specialize in backend and full-stack development, focusing on:

- **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Dart
- **Web Development:** Node.js, Flask, Angular
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Mobile Development:** Flutter (with AWS Amplify and Riverpod, also Firebase)
- **Operating Systems:** macOS, Linux

### Projects
- **Cebola** - A simplicistic macOS virus scanner using known signatures in C.
- **Chatty** - A multi-threaded chat application (client-server architecture) built in Java for self-learning purposes.
-  **Trie Parser** - A generic C++ trie (prefix tree) implementation supporting iterators, path compression, trie union operations, maximum weight leaf search, stream I/O, and a custom container (`bag`). Includes full sanitizer support for safe development.
- **Other private projects** - Working on innovative solutions in mobile and web development.
- **Graveyard of projects you will never see** - I have a library of 30+ projects, all great ideas, just not so great....
